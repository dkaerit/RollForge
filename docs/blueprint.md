# **App Name**: RollForge

## Core Features:

- Dice Combination Generator: Generative AI tool: determine suitable dice combinations to achieve a specified minimum and maximum roll range.
- Die Type Selector: Dice selection interface: present a user-friendly interface to select desired die types.
- Results Display: Clearly display suggested dice combinations with associated modifiers.
- Multiple die types allowed: Accept multiple die types to allow fine tuning
- Accept Arbitrary Min/Max Range: Accept input of arbitrary target range minimum and maximum values.
- Visualize Available Combinations: UI: Visual feedback of all possible dice combinations available to user, emphasizing dice with best probability spreads.
- Macro Range Calculator: Calculate the minimum and maximum possible results of a given dice macro (e.g., "1d8+1d4+3").
- Dice Roll Simulator: Simulate dice rolls based on a given macro.
- Combination Analysis & Simulation: Given a minimum and maximum range, calculate possible dice combinations, display the bell curve (Gaussian distribution) for each combination, and allow simulations of these combinations.  Tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft orange (#F2A365), evokes the warmth and tradition of tabletop gaming, avoiding strong emotional associations. Do not suggest teal.
- Background color: Pure black (#000000), provides a stark contrast and modern feel.
- Accent color: Desaturated blue (#8CB4C2) will provide a complementary contrast, drawing the user's attention without overwhelming the primary color.
- Body text: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) will support clarity and readability of content.
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) will contribute a touch of techiness and novelty befitting generative AI.
- Simple, outline-style icons representing different die types (d4, d6, d8, etc.)
- Clean, grid-based layout with ample whitespace for readability.
- Subtle animations (e.g., dice rolling, numbers animating) on result generation to enhance user engagement.
